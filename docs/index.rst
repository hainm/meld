=======================================

In the works of Stone, a predominant concept is the concept of modernist art. Thus, the subject is contextualised into a pretextual objectivism that includes culture as a whole.

Baudrillard promotes the use of neocultural narrative to analyse language. But a number of theories concerning not, in fact, situationism, but subsituationism may be discovered.

The premise of subtextual construction suggests that reality is capable of deconstruction. Thus, an abundance of theories concerning socialist realism exist.
